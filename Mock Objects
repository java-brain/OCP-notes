Suppose you are working on a racing application with the code that calculates the winners handled by a different team. 
Both your team and the other team agreed on a RaceManager interface, as shown in the following code, with your team 
using the interface and the other team implementing it:

public class Animal {}
public class Tortoise extends Animal {}
public class Hare extends Animal {}
public interfacae RaceManager {
  public Animal getWinner(List<Animal> animals);
}

The good news is that your team has finished its part of the project first. The bad news is that the other team has nothing 
for you to test with. While waiting for the other team to finish, you can create a mock version of the RaceManager class, 
as shown in the following sample code:

public class DummyRaceManager implements RaceManager {
  public Animal getWinner(List<Animal> animals) {
    return animals==null || animals.size()==0 ? null: animals.get(0);
  }
}
