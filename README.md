    - Completed this tutorial on enums: https://www.mkyong.com/java/java-enum-example/ 
    
- the 'method signature' is the method name and the parameter list     

- An annotation is extra information about the program, and it is a type of metadata. It can be used by the compiler or even at runtime.

- @Override is allowed only when referencing a method. Just as there is no such thing as overriding a field, the annotation cannot be used on a field either.

- Inner classes are not allowed to contain static methods or static variables. Only nested static classes are permitted to contain statics. Refer to question 8 from chapter 1 review questions for an example.

- A reminder about interfaces: An interface is an abstract data type, similar to a class that defines a list of public abstract methods that any class implementing the interface must provide. An interface may also include constant public static final variables, default methods, and static methods. 

- The compiler automatically adds 'public' to all interface methods and 'abstract' to all (non-static and non-default) methods, if the developer does not provide them. By contrast, the class implementing the interface must provide the proper modifiers. Refer to the Lion class on page 49.
