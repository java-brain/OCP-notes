Greenwich Mean Time is a time zone in Europe that is used as time zone zero when discussing offsets. 

Figuring out how far apart are these moments in time, to approach a problem like this, you subtract the time zone from the time:

2015-06-20T07:50+02:00[Europe/Paris] // GMT 2015-06-20 5:50
2015-06-20T06:50+05:30[Asia/Kolkata] // GMT 2015-06-20 1:20
