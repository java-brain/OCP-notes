A design principle is an established idea or best practice that facilitates the software design process.

Following good design principles leads to

  * More logical code
  * Code that is easier to understand
  * Classes that are easier to reuse in other relationships and applications
  * Code that is easier to maintain and that adapts more readily to changes in the application requirements

Some design principles in Java:

1) Encapsulating Data
 * With encapsulation, a class is able to maintain certain invariants about its internal data. An invariant is a 
   property or truth that is maintained even after the data is modified.
